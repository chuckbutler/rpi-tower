# Pi Tower


This is the collection of scripts, templates, and other oddities that are
required to setup the six node RPI cluster sitting on my desk. It became
apparent that at major updates I would have to re-flash the SSD drives
with whatever the updated OS is. This means resetting back to vanilla.

I hate doing things manually more than once, so this collection of scripts
shoudl alleviate a majority of the heavy lifting.

## Usage

Right now each script is numbered in terms of its expected run.

#### Getting Started

You'll need to clone this repository on each pi.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/chuckbutler/pi-tower.git
cd pi-tower
sudo install.sh
```
